# Medium to PDF Extractor v.0.0.1

The Medium to PDF Extractor API is developed using pure Dart, with Dart Frog powering the backend. This service employs Puppeteer for browser automation, utilizing pre-saved authorization cookies from a paid subscription. Users without a subscription can submit a link, and the backend will process the request and send back a PDF file containing the full article.

The project can be deployed to the server using a Docker file located in the build folder.
